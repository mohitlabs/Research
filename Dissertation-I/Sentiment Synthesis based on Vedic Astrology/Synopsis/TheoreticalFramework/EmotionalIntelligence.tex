Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize, understand and manage one's own emotions as well as the emotions of others. It involves being able to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and to navigate social situations effectively\cite{ISSN-2456-2165}.

EI is often described as having four components: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Self-awareness involves recognizing and understanding one's own emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Self-management involves being able to regulate one's own emotions and behaviors in response to different situations. Social awareness involves recognizing and understanding the emotions of others, as well as the social norms and expectations of different situations. Relationship management involves using emotional information to communicate effectively, build and maintain relationships, and resolve conflicts.

EI is considered an important factor in personal and professional success, as it can help individuals navigate social interactions, build strong relationships, and manage stress and challenges effectively.
