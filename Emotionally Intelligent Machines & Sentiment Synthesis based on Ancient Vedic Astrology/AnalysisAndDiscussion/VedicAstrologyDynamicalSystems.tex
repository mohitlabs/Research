\subsubsection{Birth Chart (An Initial Condition of Emotion Dynamics)}
The chart representing the planetary positions at the
time of the of a child which observed from the place
of birth is said as the birth chart of that person. It is like a snapshot of the universe at the time of birth of the individual. If we consider the birth chart of an individual as an initial condition for itâ€™s neurodynamical system, then we can predict many things about the future behaviour of that particular individual. Apart from that, for simplicity and for the purpose of sentiment synthesis in this paper, we are only interested about the emotion dynamics of that person.
