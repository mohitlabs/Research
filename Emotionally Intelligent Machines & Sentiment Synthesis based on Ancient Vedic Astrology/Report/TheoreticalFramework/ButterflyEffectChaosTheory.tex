Richard A. Anthes in 2022 by his paper ``Predictability \& Predictions" showed his experiences with predictability theory and weather predictions began as an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the early 1960s. His interest in numerical simulations led to the development of a simple nonlinear one-dimensional gravity wave model and later a nonlinear, baroclinic, three-dimensional model of the tropical cyclone. His experiences highlighted the challenges of numerical and physical instabilities in weather prediction models\cite{atmos13081292, encyclopedia2030084}.
In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.
