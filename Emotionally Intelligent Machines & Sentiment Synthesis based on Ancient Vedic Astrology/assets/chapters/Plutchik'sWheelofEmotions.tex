Plutchik proposed a psychoevolutionary classification approach for general emotional responses.[2][3] He considered there to be eight primary emotionsâ€”anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy.
He also created a wheel of emotions to illustrate different emotions. Plutchik first proposed his cone-shaped model (3D) or the wheel model (2D) in 1980 to describe how emotions were related \cite{enwiki:1136521972}.
