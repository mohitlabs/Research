The paper mainly describes the discussion on some similarities and relationships between the parameters of mathematical dynamical systems, ancient vedic astrology, psychology of human behaviour \& artificial neural networks which has been found during the study of Emotional Artificial Intelligence (EAI). These parameters can be useful in synthesis of sentiments in machines and algorithms by means of the generation of artificial intution based on the concept of vedic astrology which will lead to the development of more emotionally smart and intelligent systems. These type of systems can be very helpful to fullfill the current needs and requirements of emotional artificial intelligence in many areas such as in Healthcare, Education, Business Intelligence, Social Media, Automobile, etc.
