Emotional Artificial Intelligence (EAI) is the ability of AI systems to recognize, understand, and respond appropriately to human emotions. It is an emerging field of AI that focuses on building machines that can perceive, interpret, and express emotions similar to human beings. 

Emotional AI uses various techniques such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and facial recognition to detect emotions in human interactions. These techniques are then used to train algorithms and models that can predict and respond to human emotions in real-time.

Emotional AI has numerous potential applications, such as improving customer service, enhancing human-robot interactions, and providing mental health support.
