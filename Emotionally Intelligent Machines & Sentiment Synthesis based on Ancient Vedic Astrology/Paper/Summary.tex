The human mind is a very complex dynamical system that evolves over time in responses to the various inputs from the environment. To understand this in simple words, let's imagine what will happen if human mind does not have any type of memory with it or it will act as a static system. What will be our experience in this case? How does it feel like? If it will be the case, then everything will be instantaneous for us. There is no happieness, no sadness no fear \& no anger. There will be no emotions. There will be no experience of feeling anything due to the absence of memory. This will happen because our mind collects all the past experiences of our life as data in the memory and whenever will be a situation to deal, it extracts the information of the past experiences stored inside the memory, compares this information with the present input, and decides how to handle with and react in this situation. This task handling experience is stored again in the memory for the future processing.
