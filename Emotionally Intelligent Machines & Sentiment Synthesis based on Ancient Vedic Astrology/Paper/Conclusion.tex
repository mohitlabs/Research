The human mind is a very complex dynamical system that evolves over time in responses to the various inputs from the environment. The more we attempt to understand it deeply, the more we find ourselves entangled in questions. However, this pursuit provides us with new knowledge that leads to innovation and presents numerous challenges. The study of the human mind has been instrumental in the birth of artificial intelligence (AI), but there still exists a significant difference between AI and the human mind. To bridge this gap, psychology and Vedic astrology can play a crucial role, and by leveraging these theories, intuition-based AI systems could be developed in the future.
