Digital filters have become increasingly popular in various applications due to their numerous advantages. However, they also have some issues that should be considered as follows:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Sampling rate: }Digital filters require a high sampling rate to achieve a high level of accuracy, which can be challenging in some applications.
	\item \textbf{Complexity: }Digital filters can be more complex to design and implement than analog filters, requiring specialized knowledge and software tools.
	\item \textbf{Latency: }Digital filters can introduce a delay, or latency, in signal processing due to the computation time required.
	\item \textbf{Nonlinear distortion: }Digital filters can introduce nonlinear distortion, resulting in signal distortion and degradation.
	\item \textbf{Quantization noise: }Digital filters are subject to quantization noise, which can reduce the quality of the processed signal.
\end{itemize}
