	ABSTRACT = {This research work aims at providing power quality improvement for the nonlinear load to improve the system performance indices by eliminating maximum total harmonic distortion (THD) and reducing neutral wire current. The idea is to integrate a shunt hybrid active power filter (SHAPF) with the system using machine learning control techniques. The system proposed has been evaluated under an artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit, and long short-term memory for the optimization of the SHAPF. The method is based on the detection of harmonic presence in the power system by testing and comparison of traditional pq0 theory and deep learning neural networks. The results obtained through the proposed methodology meet all the suggested international standards of THD. The results also satisfy the current removal from the neutral wire and deal efficiently with minor DC voltage variations occurring in the voltage-regulating current. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated on the performance indices of accuracy and computational complexities, which show effective results in terms of 99% accuracy and computational complexities. deep learning-based findings are compared based on their root-mean-square error (RMSE) and loss function. The proposed system can be applied for domestic and industrial load conditions in a four-wire three-phase power distribution system for harmonic mitigation.},

	ABSTRACT = {Music genre classification has a significant role in information retrieval for the organization of growing collections of music. It is challenging to classify music with reliable accuracy. Many methods have utilized handcrafted features to identify unique patterns but are still unable to determine the original music characteristics. Comparatively, music classification using deep learning models has been shown to be dynamic and effective. Among the many neural networks, the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and variants of a recurrent neural network (RNN) has not been significantly considered. Additionally, addressing the flaws in the particular neural network classification model, this paper proposes a hybrid architecture of CNN and variants of RNN such as long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Bi-GRU. We also compared the performance based on Mel-spectrogram and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features. Empirically, the proposed hybrid architecture of CNN and Bi-GRU using Mel-spectrogram achieved the best accuracy at 89.30%, whereas the hybridization of CNN and LSTM using MFCC achieved the best accuracy at 76.40%.},
