The proposed work can be divided into several key tasks:

\subsection*{1. Investigate RNN-Based Filters:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Review relevant literature on RNNs in filter design.
	\item Assess suitability of RNN types for digital filters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Framework Development:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Investigate methods for calculating filter coefficients with RNNs.
	\item Develop a framework for seamless integration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Python Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Choose Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
	\item Implement RNN-based digital filter with calculated coefficients.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Performance Evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate diverse datasets for testing.
	\item Evaluate performance using key metrics (e.g., SNR, MSE).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Documentation and Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Document design, implementation, and testing.
	\item Conduct analysis of advantages and limitations.
\end{itemize}
